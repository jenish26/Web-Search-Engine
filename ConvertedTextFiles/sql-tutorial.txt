SQL Tutorial SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database such as updating records, deleting records, creating and modifying tables, views, etc. SQL is just a query language; it is not a database.

SQL is a database language, it is used for database creation, deletion, fetching rows, and modifying rows, etc. SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
